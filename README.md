# Fraud-detection-model
This notebook will focus on the details of credit card transactions and investigate through both Class 0 (non-fraudulent) and Class 1 (fraudulent) outputs (Class 1).
Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine and Decision Tree Classification models were used in predicting outcomes of credit card transactions. 
The best model to ensure a reduced risk for the organization was selected and the reliability of the model was also tested.
